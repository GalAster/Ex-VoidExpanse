$p0001:             There are problems with the oxygen generator on station %station% in the %system% system. They've requested repair parts, and we have some. You just need to deliver them. Got it?
$p0002:             There's been another alien virus attack, on station %station% in the %system% system. Similar virus attacks happen all the time across the Far Colonies. We don't know yet how the aliens are spreading their virus, but Order scientists have managed to create an antidote. We have some left since our own outbreak, you just need to deliver it to the infested station. Got it?
$p0003:             This is a mission of crucial importance. I've got an encrypted message for the commander of station %station% in the %system% system. You just need to deliver it, got it? And don't even think of opening it. It's encrypted anyway!
$p0004:             You know how a delivery works, right? You deliver something - and then get your reward. You'll get nothing by just standing there. Go! (Exp: %exp%, money: %money%d)
$p0005:             Hmmm... I'm not expecting a delivery... Let me take a look at the package.
$p0006:             Right, it's not for me. The label on this package clearly says: %station% in %system%. You should go there.
$p0007:             Wrong station, my friend. Your package is expected on %station%.
$p0008:             Ah, finally! Now we can finally fix our oxygen generator and breath free! Thank you, you've saved a lot of lives today!
$p0009:             Finally! This small vial will save a lot of lives today. You should be proud of yourself! Damn virus. If only we knew how the Xengatarn were delivering it...
$p0010:             Encrypted message? For me? Well, this should be interesting. Thank you for delivering it so quickly, my friend!
